# Zense-Application
Project used to apply to Zense Club IIITB
Instructions:
1) Install pygame module on your computer
2) The default setting for the simulation is Mercury. Thus, the ball-in-the-box motion happens on the planet Mercury.
3) To change the planet, you will have to key in a number. The order of the planets is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune. Use 1-based indexing to determine the index of the planet you want to change it to, and then enter the number in. You will get a message on terminal when the planet changes, along with the value of the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of that planet.
4) You may need to press the number multiple times, as the program seems to lag a little while taking input.
5) Enjoy the simulation!
